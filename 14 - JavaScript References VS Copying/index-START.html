    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = 100;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // So whatever the string is initially assigned to, this is what it will be.  The same is true of strings.

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';


    // however what happens when we update that array? Unlike booleans and strings, this does get updated. So you need to be careful about whether or not you are mking a copy or a reference - in the example above we are making a reference rather than a copy.
    console.log(team, players);


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way - slice usually has two variables, e.g. 1,3, which would take out the index value with 2, but when there is nothing you get the whole array as a new one.
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread - this will spread all the information into this array.
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80

    // and think we make a copy.
    // let captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead? We basically take a blank object, fold in all the properties of the object person, and then add a new
    // const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    // console.log(cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wesRD = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // So if we reassign social.twitter, using the above, it will also change that in the origin one. If we do.

    const devRD = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';

    console.log(wes, dev);
