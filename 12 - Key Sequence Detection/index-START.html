So we are splicing from the back the length of the secret code -1, in this case 5, and then taking the length of the items that have been pressed less the secret code. So this way it pushes the first letter out.

// The above cornify js, there was a function called cornify and it adds random stuff and unicorns to the screen every time you get the right combination of letters, so its quite fun.
